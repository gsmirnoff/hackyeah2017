What to add in the future?
    -machine learning (since process requires human to check the results (verify whether it's fraud or not),
     we might use results of their checks as a learning data for our model. more precise set of rules will be produced as the outcome)
    -connect other external sources of data (e.g. lookup for nip in government dbs - black lists...)
    -allow user to define a way of data fetching as series of steps
     example: (1) -> make a request GET someportal.com/api/offers/?category=electronics
              (2) -> take specific fields from response - [].offer.price, [].sellerdata.name, [].sellerdata.nip, ...
              (3) -> analyze
    -adapt application to other kinds of text analysis (e.g. define initial sets of rules)
Composition - reflected in diagram
Scalability - can be several instances of almost each part of the system
Flexibility with respect to different data sources - data sources can be specified in ui, everything goes through common interface
Application monitoring - extensive logging, which is going to be connected with elk
Performance - mostly falls in the same bucket as scalability
Accountability:
    -since initial set of rules is going to be created by real vat inspectors, it's going to be quite correct
    -since we're going to attach machine learning, rules are going to be better and better, as the model learns
Price - With amazon taken as service provider, we could adapt number of instances with respect to data load.
        Rules engine can be executed in amazon lambdas, which are even cheaper than normal instances
Portability - WE ARE IN CLOUD!!! +java

for current version we've taken the offers with "stan=nowy" from category "electronics", containing also "vat marza" anywhere in the offer.
then we filtered out the records which are not really in "condition=new" based on black list of most popular marketing tricks :)
