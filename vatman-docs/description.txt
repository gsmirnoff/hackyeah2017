What to add in the future?
    -machine learning
    -
Composition - reflected in diagram
Scalability - can be several instances of almost each part of the system
Flexibility with respect to different data sources - data sources can be specified in ui, everything goes through common interface
Application monitoring - extensive logging, which is going to be connected with elk
Performance - mostly falls in the same bucket as scalability
Accountability - With amazon taken as service provider, we could adapt number of instances with respect to data load.
                 Rules engine can be executed in amazon lambdas, which are even cheaper than mormal instances
Portability - WE ARE IN CLOUD!!! +java
